      <description>“I often compare open source to science. To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples’ ideas and making it into what science is today and the incredible advances that we have had.”
 Linus Torvalds
Security Open source projects allow for peer review. Just like with science journals. Many eyes on a project are much better than a single company taking the helm of security.</description>

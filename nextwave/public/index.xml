      <description>So you have just learned Golang, built a webserver, and are ready to show the world what you can do. That&amp;rsquo;s great! Go is a very great language that scales well. In fact, many of the tools used to deliver this web page to you are written in Go. Hugo, a static website generator, was used to build the webpage. A simple Go file server is used to serve the webpage.</description>

      <description>Many Linux advocates are familiar with CentOS server side, as well as RHEL. Fedora is often treated as the desktop RHEL distribution, instead of a fully qualified server distribution. Today we will look at several reasons to use Fedora server side, as well as compare it to other server distros.
Packages | We have hit the sweet spot Fedora lives in a sweet spot. The packages stay very stable, and i still manage to get up to date software without having to sacrifice stability (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you arch).</description>

      <description>So you have heard about it, you use it, and it also was once an endeavor that could cost quite a bit of cash. Now thanks to Letsencrypt it&amp;rsquo;s easier than ever to force HTTPS traffic to even static websites on your web server.
Letsencrypt Letsencrypt is a free CA (certificate authority) that let&amp;rsquo;s anyone that owns a domain generate a trusted certificate for that domain. There are many guides to do this, my favorite being our friends at Fedora Magazine.</description>

 Linus Torvalds
Security Open source projects allow for peer review. Just like with science journals. Many eyes on a project are much better than a single company taking the helm of security.</description>

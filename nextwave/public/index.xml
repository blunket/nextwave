      <description>Keeping private traffic private No one needs to be able to see your backend services and databases. Those are strictly for the public web-servers to access.Too many database containers are exposed and are left vulnerable to attack due to sub-par security measures. By keeping database containers only available to traffic from your web servers, you reduce your attack service and increase security for all of your users.
A single Nginx Container Centralizing keys In the land before time &amp;ndash; er, excuse me - the time before Docker containers, all SSL/TLS certifications would be stored in a centralized server on the bare metal machine.</description>

      <description>Many Linux advocates are familiar with CentOS and RHEL as their primary server distrobutions. Fedora is often treated as the desktop RHEL distribution, instead of a fully qualified server distribution.
Packages | We have hit the sweet spot The Fedora project lives in a sweet spot: the packages stay very stable, and I still manage to get up to date software without having to sacrifice stability (I&amp;rsquo;m looking at you Arch Linux).</description>

      <description>So you have heard about it, you use it, and it also was once an endeavor that could cost quite a bit of cash. Now thanks to Letsencrypt it&amp;rsquo;s easier than ever to force HTTPS traffic to even static websites on your web server.
Letsencrypt Letsencrypt is a free CA (certificate authority) that let&amp;rsquo;s anyone that owns a domain generate a trusted certificate for that domain. There are many guides to do this, my favorite being our friends at Fedora Magazine.</description>

      <title>Why open source</title>

      <description>“I often compare open source to science. To where science took this whole notion of developing ideas in the open and improving on other peoples’ ideas and making it into what science is today and the incredible advances that we have had.”
 Linus Torvalds
Security Open source projects allow for peer review. Just like with science journals. Many eyes on a project are much better than a single company taking the helm of security.</description>
